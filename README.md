Emulation on a GitHub Codespace!

## Why?

Most people want to play classic games from their era or just wanna play Mario. But noone wants to go on a deep rabbithole to just find an good pc, emulator, and rom for their game to run smoothly, so I made this!

## Setup

Just run `setup.sh` and accept the prompts.
Then go to the Ports tab and select the URL next to `desktop (6080)`.  Click that URL and then click the globe to access the desktop
